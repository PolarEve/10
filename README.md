# 10

10 is a probability based game forked from 2048. You start with a 1 (probably) and you have to fill up boards by holding down the arrow keys.

The objective of the game is to get two 10 tiles and merge them together.

The game spawns all the tiles from 1-10 with increasing rarity. However, there are MANY other tiles the game can spawn, most of which are very rare. The most notable ones are 49 (the easiest one to get, it is between 9 and 10 in rarity), 11-16 (rarer 9 realms) and 33 (beak).

As far as I am aware, the rarest tile that has ever been had is 92, sitting at 1 in every 2000000000 (2 billion) tiles.

Good luck, luck is all you need!
